**ARCHIVED**
This model uses all 48 sub-saharan african countries in the donor pool. This model was used in the first stage of the analysis and the donor pool was deemed insufficient (too small) for the analysis. See 'Model2' for the second donor pool that uses all countries available on the World Bank database.
