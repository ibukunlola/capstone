Final year thesis: Measuring the Economic Impact of Nigeria’s Exchange Control Policies

## Abstract
The purpose of this Capstone project is to explore the impact of Nigeria’s exchange control policies on economic development. A lot of developing countries employ trade restrictions for several reasons including strengthening domestic industries and the local currency, encouraging exports, and discouraging excessive imports. Nigeria is not exempt from this phenomenon as it has employed non-tariff trade barriers such as currency and capital controls, which are the areas of focus of the Capstone project. By the end of the Capstone project, I aim to come closer to answering the question: How have exchange controls affected economic growth and development in Nigeria? I will conduct an empirical analysis using synthetic interventions to quantify the effect of exchange controls, as measured by an exchange controls index, on economic indicators that will be specified in the future such as GDP, inequality, and domestic businesses’ revenue.
