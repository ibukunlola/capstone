AN IMPACT EVALUATION OF NIGERIA’S INVESTORS AND EXPORTERS FOREX WINDOW
## Abstract
This paper explores the economic impact of Nigeria’s Investors and Exporters' Foreign Exchange window. Developing countries often employ foreign exchange restrictions for various reasons, such as strengthening domestic industries and the local currency, encouraging exports, and discouraging excessive imports. Nigeria is not exempt from this phenomenon, as evidenced by the launch of a new foreign exchange window for Investors, Importers, and end-users (IEFX Window) by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). I use synthetic control to estimate the effect of the IEFX window on foreign direct investment (FDI) as an economic development indicator. The results suggest a positive impact of the IEFX window on FDI, with the more modest model showing that Nigeria had 72% more FDI per capita in Nigeria than its counterfactual in 2019.
